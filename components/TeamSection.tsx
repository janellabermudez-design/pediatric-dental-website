              Yani is a dedicated dental professional with a strong passion for pediatric dentistry. She earned her Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from a top-tier dental school, where she had the opportunity to provide care in rural and underserved communitiesâ€”an experience that deepened her commitment to patient-focused care.
              <br /><br />
              After dental school, Yani completed an Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD) residency, which solidified her passion for pediatric dentistry and inspired her to pursue advanced specialty training. She recently completed her pediatric dental residency, where she received focused training in preventive care, behavior guidance, and treating children with special health care needs.
              <br /><br />
              Yani is committed to helping children develop positive, comfortable experiences at the dentist and values building lasting relationships with families to support lifelong oral health. She is also fluent in Spanish, which allows her to provide inclusive care to a diverse patient population. Outside of dentistry, Yani enjoys staying active through running and hiking, as well as trying out new recipes and exploring different cuisines.
